You can contribute to GoDJ in 3 major ways:
<ul>
<li>Monetarily</li>
<li>Socially</li>
<li>Programmatically</li>
</ul>
Servers cost money. By contributing monetarily to our Paypal account, you can help us 
maintain basic costs associated with running an app.[TODO: INSERT PAYPAL BUTTON HERE] Another way to help out, is by
giving us a social shout out on Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, etc.[TODO: INSERT SOCIAL ICONS HERE] Getting the word
out is just as important as having a good app! Lastly if you want to help the app grow, then fork it
off of Github, make some cool features, then put it back in the repo!.[TODO: INSERT A FORK ME BUTTON  HERE]
