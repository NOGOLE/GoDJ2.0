GoDJ V2.0
=======

GoDJ V2.0 is totally rewritten using the Laravel PHP framework.
GoDJ is a web app that allows DJs to get analytical data from party goers, in the form of requests.

Party goers can send song or mood requests to a specific DJ, on the DJs dashboard he/she will see metrics about the party such as:
* How many requests they have
* Who sent the requests
* Visualizations 

With more to come!
