<p class="jumbotron" id="about">You can help contribute to GoDJ in 3 major ways:
<ul>
<li>Monetarily</li>
<li>Socially</li>
<li>Programmatically</li>
</ul>
Servers cost money. By contributing monetarily to our Paypal account, you can help us 
maintain basic costs associated with running an app. Another way to help out, is by
giving us a social shout out on Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, etc. Getting the word
out is just as important as having a good app! Lastly if you want to help the app grow, then fork it
off of Github, make some cool features, then put it back in the repo!.
