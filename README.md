GoDJ V2.0
=======

GoDJ V2.0 is totally rewritten using the Laravel PHP framework for the backend, with the front end using Angular.js/Bootstrap/jQuery.

GoDJ allows bilateral communication between music listeners and DJs. Listeners can submit requests (song/mood) to a DJ and that DJ sees on their dashboard, a set of analytical data respresenting listener requests. This allows for:
-Better party atmospheres
-Better radio play
