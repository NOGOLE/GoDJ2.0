GoDJ V2.0
=======


GoDJ is a real-time audience analytics app for party and radio DJs. The concept is simple. Music listeners go to the home page ( or on the GoDJ mobile app) and submit either:

- A song request
OR
- A mood request


to a particular DJ identified by their DJ name. The DJ's get the notifications in real-time on their DJ dashboard (or on the GoDJ Admin mobile app). The dashboard currently has 3 data visualizations:

- Song vs. Mood radar chart
- Song vs. Mood polar chart
- Song and Mood list tables

More visualizations are in the works, and include:
- Request per hour line chart
- Request heat map
- and more

Why is this useful for DJs?
For party DJs it is simple. You can see in real-time your listeners requests, no more people losing their voice trying to yell a song request at the DJ next to the speakers in the club! You as a DJ can see the vibe. For radio DJs the incentive is more on the business side. Ads drive revenue. GoDJ will allow you to collect data on your listeners, seeing what their interests are, where they are located, etc. Using this information, stations and marketers can better tailor their ads to reach their target niche audience. BEST OF ALL IT IS FREE!!
