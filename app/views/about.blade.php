<p class="jumbotron" id="about">GoDJ is an app developed by NOGOLE LLC. That allows DJs to gather real time data 
about parties they are DJing at, provided by the party goers.
<br>
This is done via song and mood requests. The partygoers submit requests for either a change in song
or a change in mood. The DJ's get the requests as well as analytical charts to show the vibe of the party.
<br>THIS IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR DJs!!<br>

This app is used BY DJs to enhance the party they are spinning at. </p>
